# skeleton
Having fun with canvas and javascript in a basic flask app.

I set up a very simple flask app that displays a webpage with a canvas image of a skeleton. I used javascript to make the skeleton's eyes (i know, skeletons don't have eyes!) follow your mouse cursor in realtime as you move it around the page.
